### 1. [Zero Knowledge Protocol](https://medium.com/@argongroup/on-zero-knowledge-proofs-in-blockchains-14c48cfd1dd1)
Zero Knowledge Protocols (or zero knowledge proofs) are based on a cryptographic proof which defines a method that allows a "prover" to prove their knowledge to a "verifier" without sharing the information in question. ZKP's enable a system of authentication with complete anonymity. For example this would allow cryptocurrency transactions to be processed and verified while important transaction information remains securely hidden.

### 2. [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
TensorFlow is a library of open-source machine learning software. It was built by Google, initially for internal research and production of applications, then released to the public in 2015. TensorFlow uses deep learning neural networks to compute data-flow graphs for a variety of tasks. Google also developed an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)for TensorFlow, the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). An example of an app built with TensorFlow is Google's DeepDream.

### 3. [Generative Adversarial Networks]()


### 4. [WebAuthn](https://webauthn.org/)


### 5.
