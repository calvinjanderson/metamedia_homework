## WEEK 4

### 1. [Zero Knowledge Protocol](https://medium.com/@argongroup/on-zero-knowledge-proofs-in-blockchains-14c48cfd1dd1)
Zero Knowledge Protocols (or zero knowledge proofs) are based on a cryptographic proof which defines a method that allows a "prover" to prove their knowledge to a "verifier" without sharing the information in question. ZKP's enable a system of authentication with complete anonymity. For example this would allow cryptocurrency transactions to be processed and verified while important transaction information remains securely hidden.

### 2. [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
<<<<<<< HEAD
TensorFlow is a library of open-source machine learning software. It was built by Google, initially for internal research and production of applications, then released to the public in 2015. TensorFlow uses deep learning neural networks to compute data-flow graphs for a variety of tasks. Google also developed an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)for TensorFlow, the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). An example of an application built with TensorFlow is Google's DeepDream.

### 3. [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://skymind.ai/wiki/generative-adversarial-network-gan)
Generative Adversarial Networks are neural networks that are able to learn  to replicate data and create new data. GANs use generative algorithms and discriminative algorithms in opposition to generate data then verify the authenticity of the data.

### 4. [WebAuthn](https://webauthn.org/)
WebAuthn is an application programming interface which uses cryptographic methods that do not require passwords or other similar forms of authentication. The WebAuthn API creates sets of private and public keys for each credential that is registered. This protects information that can only be decrypted once the proper keys are validated. Biometrics or USB security keys would replace conventional passwords.
