## WEEK 6

### Idea No. 12: Bulletin Board Systems
CBBS was the first Bulletin Board System created by Ward Christensen
Heatwave BBS is an active bbs for a community of fans of the TI-99/4a Home pc. it is still accessible through the telnet address: heatwave.ddns.net:9640

### Idea No. 36: GeoCities
In response to Yahoo! shutting down GeoCities multiple groups took action to preserve the massive collection of web pages and user accounts.
- Dragan Espenschied, a net artist, managed to archive large portions of GeoCities pages through his project [One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age](http://blog.geocities.institute/).

- [Geocities.ws](http://www.geocities.ws) has recovered and archived hundreds of thousands of web pages that are accessible through its searchable archive. Geocities.ws actively provides hosting services for users who want to maintain and update their GeoCities pages.
