### Idea No.19: The Emoticon </h3>

A flame war is the result of misinterpreted joke responses on early forum posts.The emoticon was introduced to message boards to indicate to readers when posts were serious or not.

<a href="https://www.britannica.com/story/whats-the-difference-between-emoji-and-emoticons" target="blank">Encyclopedia Brittanica</a>
defines an emoticon as "punctuation marks, letters, and numbers used
to create pictorial icons that generally display an emotion or sentiment."
Emoticon are usually combinations of ASCII characters.
Emoji are pictographic characters that originated in Japan. Emoji are
standalone characters with "distinct styles" compared to emoticon
which are pictographs made from characters available on a keyboard.

### Idea No.24: The JPEG
Boulton calls the JPEG a 'lossy' filetype because the jpeg compression
algorithm is designed to keep only the most essential data in the image
file. Repeated compression of a JPEG will eventually result in visible
loss of image quality due to data being discarded.

GIF, TIFF, and RAW filetypes use algorithms that produce "lossless"
compression to preserve data.

### Idea No.45: Metadata
File size: metadata can include information about the total volume
of bytes in a file or folder.

Geo-Tags: GPS data such as latitude and longitude coordinates.

Date Created/Modified: information related to the file's creation and edit history.

Administrative: restrictions to access can be applied through administrative metadata.
