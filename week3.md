        <p> A flame war is the result of misinterpreted joke responses on early
          forum posts.The emoticon was introduced to message boards to indicate
          to readers when posts were serious or not. </p>
        <p> <a href="https://www.britannica.com/story/whats-the-difference-between-emoji-and-emoticons" target="_blank">Encyclopedia Brittanica</a>
          defines an emoticon as "punctuation marks, letters, and numbers used
          to create pictorial icons that generally display an emotion or sentiment."

      <h3>Idea No.24: The JPEG</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <article>
        <p> Boulton calls the JPEG a 'lossy' filetype because the jpeg compression
          algorithm is designed to keep only the most essential data in the image
          file. Repeated compression of a JPEG will eventually result in visible
          loss of image quality due to data being discarded. </p>
        <p> GIF, TIFF, and RAW filetypes use algorithms that produce "lossless"
          compression to preserve data. </p>
